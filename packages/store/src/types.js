/**
 * @typedef {Passable} Key

 *
 * Keys are so named because they can be used as keys in CopyMaps and
 * [agoric-sdk Stores](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/store/docs/store-taxonomy.md),
 * and as elements in CopySets and CopyBags.
 *
 * Keys cannot contain promises or errors, as these do not have useful

/**
 * @typedef {Passable} Pattern
 *
 * Patterns are Passable arbitrarily-nested pass-by-copy containers
 * (CopyArray, CopyRecord, CopySet, CopyBag, CopyMap) in which every
 * non-container leaf is either a Key or a Matcher, or such leaves in isolation
 * with no container.
 *
 * A Pattern acts as a declarative total predicate over Passables, where each
 * Passable is either matched or not matched by it. Every Key is also a Pattern
 * that matches only "itself", i.e., Keys that are `keyEQ` to it according to
 * the key distributed equality semantics.
 *
 * Patterns cannot contain promises or errors, as these do
 * not have useful distributed equality or matching semantics. Likewise,
 * no Pattern can distinguish among promises, or distinguish among errors.
 * Patterns also cannot contain any CopyTaggeds except for those recognized as
 * CopySets, CopyBags, CopyMaps, or Matchers.
 *
 * Be aware that we may recognize more CopyTaggeds over time, including
 * CopyTaggeds recognized as Patterns.
 *
 * Whether a Passable is matched by a given Pattern is location independent.
 * If a given Passable and Pattern are passed to another location,
 * the Passable will be matched by the Pattern there iff the Passable is matched
 * by the Pattern here.
 *
 * Patterns are often used in a type-like manner, to represent the category
 * of Passables that the Pattern is intended* to match. To keep this
 * distinction clear, we often use the suffix "Shape" rather than "Pattern"
 * to avoid confusion when the Pattern itself represents
 * some category of Pattern. For example, an "AmountShape" represents the
 * category of Amounts. And "AmountPatternShape" represents the
 * category of Patterns over Amounts.
 *
 * * We say "intended" above because Patterns, in order to be declarative
 * and Passable, cannot have the generality of predicates written in a
 * Turing-universal programming language. Rather, to represent the category of
 * things intended to be a Foo, a FooShape should reliably
 * accept all Foos and reject only non-Foos. However, a FooShape may also accept
 * non-Foos that "look like" or "have the same shape as" genuine Foos.
 * An accurate predicate for e.g. input validation would need to supplement the
 * Pattern check with code to detect the residual cases.
 * We hope the "Shape" metaphor helps remind us of this type-like imprecision
 * of Patterns.

/**

 *
 * This comparison function is valid as argument to

 * but, depending on your definitions, this is technically incorrect because
 * it may return `0` to indicate that two distinguishable elements such as
 * `-0` and `0` are tied (i.e., are in the same equivalence class
 * for the purposes of this ordering). If each such equivalence class is
 * a *rank* and ranks are disjoint, then this "rank order" is a
 * true total order over these ranks. In mathematics this goes by several
 * other names such as "total preorder".
 *
 * This function establishes a total rank order over all passables.
 * To do so it makes arbitrary choices, such as that all strings
 * are after all numbers. Thus, this order is not intended to be
 * used directly as a comparison with useful semantics. However, it must be
 * closely enough related to such comparisons to aid in implementing
 * lookups based on those comparisons. For example, in order to get a total
 * order among ranks, we put `NaN` after all other JavaScript "number" values
 * (i.e., IEEE 754 floating-point values). But otherwise, we rank JavaScript
 * numbers by signed magnitude, with `0` and `-0` tied. A semantically useful
 * ordering would also compare magnitudes, and so agree with the rank ordering
 * of all values other than `NaN`. An array sorted by rank would enable range
 * queries by magnitude.

 */

/**
 * @callback KeyCompare
 * `compareKeys` implements a partial order over keys. As with the
 * rank ordering produced by `compareRank`, -1, 0, and 1 mean
 * "less than", "equivalent to", and "greater than" respectively.
 * NaN means "incomparable" --- the first key is not less, equivalent,
 * or greater than the second. For example, subsets over sets is
 * a partial order.
 *
 * By using NaN for "incomparable", the normal equivalence for using
 * the return value in a comparison is preserved.
 * `compareKeys(left, right) >= 0` iff `left` is greater than or
 * equivalent to `right` in the partial ordering.
 *
 * Key order (a partial order) and rank order (a total preorder) are
 * co-designed so that we store Passables in rank order and index into them
 * with keys for key-based queries. To keep these distinct, when speaking
 * informally about rank, we talk about "earlier" and "later". When speaking
 * informally about keys, we talk about "smaller" and "bigger".
 *
 * In both orders, the return-0 case defines
 * an equivalence class, i.e., those that are tied for the same place in the
 * order. The global invariant that we need between the two orders is that the
 * key order equivalence class is always at least as precise as the
 * rank order equivalence class. IOW, if `compareKeys(X,Y) === 0` then
 * `compareRank(X,Y) === 0`. But not vice versa. For example, two different
 * remotables are the same rank but incomparable as keys.
 *
 * A further invariant is if `compareKeys(X,Y) < 0` then
 * `compareRank(X,Y) < 0`, i.e., if X is smaller than Y in key order, then X
 * must be earlier than Y in rank order. But not vice versa.
 * X can be equivalent to or earlier than Y in rank order and still be
 * incomparable with Y in key order. For example, the record `{b: 3, a: 5}` is
 * earlier than the record `{b: 5, a: 3}` in rank order but they are
 * incomparable as keys. And two distinct remotables such as `Far('X', {})` and
 * `Far('Y', {})` are equivalent in rank order but incomparable as Keys.
 *
 * This lets us translate a range search over the
 * partial key order into a range search over rank order followed by filtering
 * out those that don't match. To get this effect, we store the elements of
 * a set in an array sorted in reverse rank order, from later to earlier.
 * Combined with our lexicographic comparison of arrays, if set X is a subset
 * of set Y then the array representing set X will be an earlier rank that the
 * array representing set Y.

 * `basePatt`, and the remainder, which is matched against `rest` if present.
 *
 * @property {(basePatt: CopyRecord<*> | CopyArray<*>,
 *             rest?: Pattern,
 * ) => Matcher} partial
 * Deprecated. Use `M.splitArray` or `M.splitRecord` instead.
 * An array or record is split into the first part that is matched by
 * `basePatt`, and the remainder, which is matched against `rest` if present.
 * `M.partial` differs from `M.split` in the handling of data that is
 * described in `basePatt` but absent in a provided specimen:
 *   - For a CopyRecord, `M.partial` ignores properties of `basePatt`
 *     that are not present on the specimen.
 *   - For a CopyArray, `M.partial` ignores elements of `basePatt`
 *     at indices beyond the maximum index of the specimen.
 *
 * @property {(subPatt: Pattern) => Pattern} eref
 * Matches any Passable that is either matched by `subPatt` or is a promise object.
 * Note that validation is immediate, so (unlike the TypeScript ERef<T>
 * type) `M.eref` matches a promise object whose fulfillment value is
 * _not_ matched by `subPatt`.
 * For describing a top-level parameter,
 * `M.callWhen(..., M.await(p), ...)` is preferred over `M.call(..., M.eref(p), ...)`
 * because the former always checks against the sub-Pattern (awaiting fulfillment
 * if necessary) while the latter bypasses such checks when the relevant argument
 * is a promise.
 *
 * @property {(subPatt: Pattern) => Pattern} opt
 * Matches any Passable that is matched by `subPatt` or is the exact value `undefined`.
